Test Points:
  - will message
  - username and password
  - connect flags
  - keep alive timeout
  - stress testing (receiving/sending hundreds/thousands of messages of all sizes)
  - publishing:
    - all QoS levels
    - empty, small and large application messages
    - retain and no-retain
  - subscribing:
    - multiple topics (being published from multiple sources)
    - max QoS level flags
    - wildcards
  - check that unsubscribing from topics works
  - disconnect and reconnect (in the same program)



  test_client <client number> <initial seed> <num topics> <subscribe list ...>
    - create new thread (calling __mqtt_send and __mqtt_recv every 100ms)
    - lfsr to generate data to publish
    - reveive data and check that it's correct (using seed from other test clients)



  seed for client 1 = initial seed + client number (1) = 1235
  client 1 publishes topics with the format: topic-client1/1..12
